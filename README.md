## Welcome!

Please pick up your key fob at the front desk. It will be listed by one of us under your full legal name.

This fob allows you access to everything you need, including common areas, elevators, our apartment, and the building itself.

Once you have your key fob, proceed to the elevators. Scan your fob by holding it beneath the black touchpad, then tap "resident floors". Tap the left arrow to navigate to the lower block of floors, then tap 12. The screen will indicate the elevator to which you've been assigned.

## Our Apartment

Once on the twelfth floor, proceed to apartment 1215: your home away from home. Scan your key fob at our door to unlock; when leaving, do likewise, but bear in mind that it takes a moment for the deadbolt to engage. When locking the door, wait for the green light to flash and you should hear the sound of the door locking itself.

In the entryway, you'll find two sets of light switches. The bank along the outside wall (closer to the door) control the hallway and kitchen overhead lights; the Hue switch next to the thermostat (closer to the fridge) controls everything else. Press the top button on the Hue switch to cycle through the various lighting scenes in the main living area.

The drawers in the front entryway have Beta's things (top drawer) as well as all the chargers/charging cables you might need (drawer second from the top).

We're a shoes-off apartment. There's a small space beneath the drawers in the front entryway for you to stow your kicks. If you happen to need it, the vacuum cleaner is mounted to the wall in the bedroom closet.

There is extra toilet paper and extra towels in the lower cabinet to the left of the bathroom sink. There are also extra paper towel rolls in the cabinet above the sink. 

Feel free to do laundry as well. Tide Pods are above the washer/dryer. 

## Release The Hound

When we're away, Beta stays in a crate located in our bedroom. Go ahead and let her out. We're sorry about the barking. It will stop once she concludes that you're not a threat, which can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. To prevent the latter, there are treats in a plastic tub atop the bookshelf. Establish yourself as a source of food, and she will be on her best behavior.

## WiFi Access

On the inside door of the upper cabinet located to the right of the refrigerator, you will find a QR code. If you've got an iPhone, just point your camera app at the code, and you'll see a "Join Umami" action appear at the top of your screen. Tap it, and you're online. (Android users, you're on your own. Maybe [this](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/03/13/android-q-lets-you-share-and-connect-to-wifi-networks-with-qr-codes/) will help?)

## Hey, Siri

Want to watch TV or play some video games or do some VR?

"Hey, Siri! Turn on/off the Television/Playstation/Nintendo." Note that Siri can't actually turn on the Nintendo Switch, you have to do that manually. The Switch is in the cabinet along the window, beneath the turntable.

All the controllers you might need are in the gray drawer under the Peachtree audio unit. Gently push and it will open.

## Building Amenities (7th Floor)

### Wooftop Dog Run

Yes, it's actually called that. Just follow the paw prints and signs, or better yet, just let Beta lead. She knows the way.

Upon returning from your walk, please wipe Beta's feet and lady bits with the Nature's Miracle wipes, located in the top drawer of the grey cabinet by the entryway. Her feet are a bit sensitive, so please be gentle. As a reward, you may give her a Dentastix after your first walk of the day; and 2-3 Chicken Apple Bark chips thereafter.

### Pro Fit Gym

Our 24-hour fitness center includes free weights, cardio equipment, Peloton bikes, and a yoga studio. There's also an Outrace Fitness System, an outdoor multi-training... thing. It's cool. Kind of like a jungle gym for adults.

Orangetheory Fitness hosts free classes on Mondays and Thursdays at 7pm. Complimentary yoga classes are also offered on Saturday mornings at 9:00.

Your workout plan for 5am tomorrow morning is as follows:

| Exercise         | Sets | Reps |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Barbell Squats   | 5    | 5    |
| Bench Press      | 5    | 5    |
| Barbell Shrugs   | 5    | 5    |
| Tricep Extension | 3    | 8    |
| Bicep Curls      | 3    | 8    |

Just kidding. You can do this workout at whatever time of day you choose. Just make sure to stretch afterwards.

Dogs are also not allowed in the common areas (apart from the dog run, obviously). If you wish to enjoy a dog by the fire, Instagram will provide you with a wide assortment of adorable photos.

The building provides wifi in all common areas. The password for the "Aven Guest" network is `beourguest`.

**Pro tip:** if you look in the reflection of the building across the street, you can tell how busy the pool is from our apartment!

### The Ojai Deck

On the 32nd floor, you'll find an additional fireplace, quiet and comfortable seating, fresh citrus trees, and panoramic views of the city (including the Hollywood sign).

No dogs are allowed in this area.

## Meet your robot roommate

If you need help with anything, just ask, "Alexa, open the apartment guide." She knows where everything is and is located next to the coffee maker. You can ask her things like:

- Where is the dog leash?
- How do I turn on the television?
- What's the phone number for the vet?
- When will this dystopian nightmare finally end?

If you need to know where anything is, Alexa will hook you up.

### Feeding & Medication

As you may already be aware, Beta is on a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs following a relapse of [IMHA](http://scvsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Immune-Mediated-Hemolytic-Anemia-Canine.pdf) (Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia) and [ITP](http://scvsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Immune-Mediated-Thrombocytopenia-Canine.pdf) (Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia). TL;DR: her immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets and red blood cells.

Medication is given twice a day. Hiding her pills in a dogfood and peanutbutter meatball is the easiest way for the medicine to go down. 

Here's the technique we use:

![Meatbell](meatball.jpg)

1. Wear latex gloves! She's on some heavy-duty shit that has to be handled carefully.
2. Gather her pills onto a small square of paper towel, into a pharmaceutical mise en place of sorts. 
3. Grab a small scoop of wet dog food with one hand.
4. With the other hand, spread a smear of peanut butter onto the top of the dog food with a butter knife.
5. Press each pill into the smear of peanut butter.
6. Spread another smear of peanut butter on top, sealing the pills in place.
7. Top the meatball off with another scoop of wet dogfood, and form into a sphere.

At some point in this process, Beta will have realized what's going down, and should now be underfoot. Place the meatball on the floor, and walk away. She will inspect your offering, and if it pleases her, she will consume it. Your presence during this ritual can inhibit this process. I like to walk into the bathroom, where I can quietly monitor the process from the mirror. Sometimes it takes a while for her to decide to eat it.

In the morning, she gets the following as a meatball:

- 125mg mycophenolate (1/4 of a white pill, pre-cut)
- 50mg cyclosporine (1 big yellow pill)
- 10mg fluoxetine (1 white/blue pill)
- Half a pepcid (1/2 a small pink pill, they should be pre-cut for you already)

After she has her drug meatball, she gets breakfast: 

- 1/2 can wet food 
- 1/8th teaspoon Tylan powder (located in the refrigerator)
- 1/8th teaspoon Entoroflora powders (located in the refrigerator) 
- 10 drops of Rescue Remedy (in the blue dropper, also in the fridge) 
- 2 scoops dry food

There is a â…›tsp measuring spoon in the fridge as well. 

Her evening pill regimen is simpler.

Evening meatball:

- 125mg mycophenolate (1/4 of a white pill, pre-cut)
- Half a pepcid (1/2 a small pink pill, they should be pre-cut for you already)

Dinner:
- 10 drops of Rescue Remedy (in the blue dropper, also in the fridge) 
- 1 scoop dry food

### Water

Beta is usually only given water when fed. Fill her bowl about halfway with lukewarm water. If it's too cold, she may throw it back up (but don't be alarmed if that happens! It's pretty common in older doggos).

### Emergencies

You can reach Beta's vet, Dr. Gorksi, at (213) 613-1537, during normal business hours: weekdays 8am-7pm, and weekends 8am-noon. **In the event of an after-hours emergency,** [ACCESS Specialty Animal Hospital](https://accessanimalhospitals.com) in Culver City is the nearest 24-hour emergency care facility. Jump in a Lyft, and give them a call at (310) 558-6100 to let them know you're on your way. Naturally, we'll reimburse you for any costs.

### "Accidents"

If she happens to have an accident inside the house, wipe it up with paper towels and then pour a small amount of Nature's Miracle on it as well. It is located under the sink in a red jug.

### When You Go Out

Beta is crated when you leave the apartment without her. Grab a Kong Toy from the freezer, or a few Chicken Apple Bark chips, show them to her, then toss them in her crate. Close the crate door once she's inside. We find it helpful to close the bedroom door behind us when we leave, so she wont wake up if there's a noise in the hallway.
